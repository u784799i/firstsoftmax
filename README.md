# firstsoftmax
This is the samplest project in deeplearning with tensorflow. Downloan MNIST_data by yourself and copy it in this program's file.
VAE(Variational AutoEncoder):1 hidden layer, put it with the file of MNIST_data together. Using relu and increasing batch_size can reduce cost.
'layer' is a one hidden layer network, and increases accuracy from fistsoftmax's 92% to 98%.
